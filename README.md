# DeepLearningInVision_GW

Project created as part of my studies during HSLU in the program MSc Data Science.

The goal was to train a GAN (CNN) to create pictures of animals, dogs or cats to be specific, wearing glasses.
We trained the model to learn features from human faces with glasses and animal pictures.

Training and testing was done in Google Colab as a result of the heavy processing power needed.

The results were not great, but given the time, resources and input data, still a success.

Code is in Python.

Please refer to the presentation in the repository for more information.
